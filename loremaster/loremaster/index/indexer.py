"""The batch :class:`Indexer` — config → source → chunk → embed → records → store.

This is the integration centerpiece (plan AMENDMENT 1 / D5–D7). A standalone,
dependency-injected, OOP indexer that builds and refreshes a project's Qdrant
index, one tier at a time. It is consumed two ways:

* the deploy/CI **CLI** (:mod:`loremaster.index.cli`) wires the real
  :class:`~loremaster.store.qdrant.QdrantStore`, a real
  :class:`loresigil.base.Embedder` (via ``make_embedder``), the SQLite
  :class:`~loremaster.index.manifest.Manifest`, the composed
  :class:`~lorescribe.registry.ChunkerRegistry`, and the per-static-tier
  :class:`~loremaster.source.local_directory.LocalDirectorySourceProvider`s, then
  runs it;
* the future watcher reuses :meth:`Indexer.index_file` for one-file incremental
  updates.

The invariants this module owns (each pinned by ``tests/test_indexer.py``):

**Per-tier freshness (D5).** A STATIC tier compares ``config.version`` against
the tier's stamp in the manifest ``meta``. CHANGED/absent → ``acquire`` the
snapshot via the tier's provider, then rebuild (selectively, via
``delete_by_tier``) and re-stamp. MATCH → SKIP with **zero filesystem walk**. A
LIVE tier does a full walk + per-file index every run (the watcher handles
incremental later, out of scope here).

**Per-file pipeline (`index_file`).** Honour the manifest mtime+size fast-path
(unchanged ``indexed`` file → skip, zero embeds). Otherwise chunk via
``registry.dispatch_file`` with a real :class:`~lorescribe.models.ChunkContext`
(the embedder's token counter + ``max_input_tokens`` injected); embed the chunk
texts; build records via ``chunk_to_record(..., tier=tier)``; **upsert the NEW
points BEFORE purging the stale ones** for that ``(tier, file)`` (dedupe by
deterministic point-id) so a concurrent reader never sees a gap; commit the
manifest row transactionally (``state='indexed'``).

**Resilience.** A permanently-failed embed (a ``None`` vector) OR a non-finite
vector (an ``isfinite`` guard — one NaN poisons cosine/argmax across every
query) marks the file ``failed``, stores **no** vectors for it, and lets the
other files continue; the failure is surfaced in the returned
:class:`IndexSummary`.

**Selective rebuild.** Rebuilding one tier uses ``delete_by_tier`` so sibling
tiers are untouched (the C1 primitive).
